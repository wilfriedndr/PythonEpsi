In this project, you 'll have to build a hangman game where the player has the guess a word, letter by letter.
The player should be allowed 6 wrong guesses until the player looses.

Using the file words.txt, pick a random word and display it, but replace the characters by underscores.

Then, prompt the player for a letter.

If the letter is contained in the word, display the word again with the letter at the correct positions.

If it isn't, decrement the number of guesses and tell the player how many wrong guesses are left remaining (or draw the hangman in ascii)

An example interaction can look like this:

>>> Welcome to Hangman!

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ 

>>> Guess your letter: S

Incorrect! You have 5 more guesses...

>>> Guess your letter: E

E _ _ _ _ _ E

[...]

E L E V A T E

Well done !
